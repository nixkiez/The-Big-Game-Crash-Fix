The Big Game Crash Fix -- nixkiez

This mod aims to restore the screen after the game has crashed and black screened in The Big Game. This was a very early fix as i just fixed it last night. I want to push this out as fast as i can so that everyone can have this, so it is not perfect, the game still gets very loud, it still will crash for 15 seconds, it will still freeze for 15 seconds, you just have to press a button to re render the screen.

Installation:

Requires derpy's script loader version 9

Simply drag the 'fix' folder into the scripts folder inside derpy's script loader, and that's it.

How To Use:

When the screen goes black, simply keep spamming the pause button to know when the game unfreezes, then when it does unfreeze, simply press the Up Button on your keyboard or controller, which ever button you use to go into manual aiming on the controller or keyboard you are using to control the game with.

Update: 

This fix is now automatic, and should prevent it from crashing in the mission ever again. Only the DSL version is automatic.
